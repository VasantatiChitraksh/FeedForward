## 🌟 **The Big Idea**  
### **The Problem:**  
Current food donation and distribution systems are:  
- 💔 Fragmented, leaving food insecure families underserved.  
- 🔍 Lacking visibility for food banks and their resources.  
- ⏳ Slow in crisis response, resulting in delays during emergencies.  
- 🚫 Inefficient at connecting donors, food banks, restaurants, and volunteers.  

### **Our Solution:**  
FeedForward is here to revolutionize the food donation landscape by:  
✅ **Registering food banks** and connecting them with local resources.  
✅ **Engaging volunteers** with task assignments and progress tracking.  
✅ Using **geo-tagging** to locate food resources near you.  
✅ Encouraging **restaurants** to donate surplus food to food banks.  
✅ **Gamifying impact tracking** to encourage donations and volunteering through rewards and leaderboards.  
✅ Deploying a **crisis response mechanism** for emergencies, enabling faster coordination.
